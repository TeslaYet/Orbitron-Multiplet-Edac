(1) How to compile and run the code.

go into ./src
compile the source code with the script
./compile
you may change the compile script omitting labla.f and linking to your Lapack library

the executable ("multiplet") can be run interactively, but this is very difficult to understand.
A sample input file is "multiplet_input.txt", so you may run
./multiplet < multiplet_input.txt
See the file "multiplet_input.commented" for the meaning of the entries

(2) The example "Output" was obtained as follows:

mkdir Output ; cd Output 
../src/multiplet < ../multiplet_input.txt 

The important output file is "rpesalms.dat".
It contains the (resonant) photoelectron wave amplitudes "A"
The data is organized as follows
1st line: nomega ngst nfst nlms
loop 1,nomega
  omega
  loop 1,ngst 
    gstweight
    loop 1,fst
      Ef
      loop 1,nlms 
         Re{A(q=-1)} Im{A(q=-1)} Re{A(q=0)} Im{A(q=0)} Re{A(q=1)} Im{A(q=1)}

where
 nomega is the number of omega (photon energy) point in the scan
 ngst is the degeneracy of the ground state
 nfst is the number of final state multiplet states "f" without the photoelectron
      For a (3d^n) ground state, these are the 2p^6 3d^{n-1} multiplets

q=-1,0,1 are 3 different light polarizations (helicity -1, z-pol and helicity +1)
gstweight is the statistical weight of the (degenerate) ground state
In this implementation gstweight = 1./ngst
so that degenerate ground states are averaged over.

A are the complex photoelectron amplitudes
